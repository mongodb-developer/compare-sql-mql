# compare-sql-mql
A repository with SQL and MQL data and queries for comparison purposes

The `setup` directory has the SQL and MongoDB schema/data, as well as a traditional SQL entity-relationship diagram. 

The SQL data is in MySQL's version of SQL syntax.

The MongoDB data comes from the sample database called sample_supplies - it is included for completeness' sake. The MongoDB data is easily installed by following the instructions at https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/, or you can use `mongoimport` with the sales.json file.
